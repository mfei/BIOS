The proof for (a) can be found in Shao section 3.3.3 pages 190-191.  This is a
famous result from Rao which characterizes the conditions under which LSE is
still the BLUE when the assumptions of the linear model are violated.

The proof for (b) can be found in Shao section 4.3 in Theorem 4.15 and example
4.27, pages 269-272.  The problem is an application of the James-Stein estimator
to the linear model.

There is currently no source or solution for (c).
