\section{F distribution}

In probability theory and statistics, the noncentral F-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is a noncentral generalization of the (ordinary) F-distribution. It describes the distribution of the quotient 
$(X / n_1)/(Y / n_2)$, where the numerator X has a noncentral chi-squared distribution with $n_1$ degrees of freedom and the denominator Y has a central chi-squared distribution with $n_2$ degrees of freedom. It is also required that X and Y are statistically independent of each other.


Under the alternative hypothesis, F follows a non-central F-distribution $F_{k-1, n-k}(\lambda)$, this $\lambda$ is the same as scaled chi-square distribution (\sigma^2 \chi^(\lambda))

\begin{align*}
\lambda &= \sum_{i=1}^n n_i (\mu_{i.} - \mu_{..})^2
\end{align*}
