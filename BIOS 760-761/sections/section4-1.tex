\section{Conditional Distribution}

Conditional distribution is used in sufficient statistics (ie. show T(X) is sufficient which the distribution based on sufficient statistics does not depend on $\theta$), 
UMVUE $E[\theta | T(X)]$, nuisance parameter $p(\theta_1 | \theta_2,.. \theta_n, X)$, Bayesian statistics. 

Basically we can write the distribution of the based on statistics, if not, we will write the integral
