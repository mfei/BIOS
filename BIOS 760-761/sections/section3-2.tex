\section{Sample Variance Distribution}

Suppose that $X_1,..X_n$ are i.i.d. with $E(X_i) = \mu, Var(X_i) = \sigma^2$, and $Var\Big[ (X_i- \mu)^2 \Big] = \tau < \infty$. Define $S_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2$. Find the asymptotic distribution of $S_n^2 $.

We have several methods to get the asymptotic distribution:

1. Direct method: Get the mean and variance, then use CLT;

2. Delta method: when there is a function of the known distribution, ie. We know $X$ distribution, then we would like to know $f(X)$ distribution. The key is to get the mean and variance of the new function, which we times the derivative

In this problem, we could use the given information to use CLT method:

WRONG METHOD:
\begin{align*}
S_n^2 &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - E(X_i) + E(X_i) - \bar{X}_n)^2, \qquad \text{construct the variance component} \\
&= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n  \Big(X_i - E(X_i) \Big)^2 + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \Big(E(X_i) - \bar{X}_n \Big)^2 \\
&= \sigma^2 +  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \Big(E(X_i) - \bar{X}_n \Big)^2  \qquad \text{THIS IS WRONG}
\end{align*}

CAN'T SAY $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n  \Big(X_i - E(X_i) \Big)^2 =  \sigma^2 $, as this is not expectation, it is sample mean/variance. 


CORRECT METHOD:

We need to use the information $Var\Big[ (X_i- \mu)^2 \Big] = \tau < \infty$, to construct a CLT with variance component of $(X_i- \mu)$. 
To simplify, let $Y_i= X_i - \mu, \bar{Y}_n= \bar{X}_n - \mu$,

\begin{align*}
S_n^2 &=  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i^2 - \bar{Y}_n^2 \\
Var \Big( Y_i^2 \Big) &= \tau^2, \qquad E \Big( Y_i^2 \Big) = E \Big( (X_i - \mu)^2 \Big) = \sigma^2 \\
\bar{Y}_n^2 & \xrightarrow{d} 0
\end{align*}

It is very tricky to notice this, we only see the mean has asymptotic distribution based on CLT, while other series does not have asymptotic distribution. $\bar{Y}_n^2$ is only a number.
By slutsky theorem,

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{n} \Big(S_n^2 - \sigma^2 \Big) &= \sqrt{n} \Big(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i^2 - \sigma^2 \Big) + \sqrt{n} \bar{Y}_n^2 \\
\sqrt{n} \Big(S_n^2 - \sigma^2 \Big) & \xrightarrow{d} N(0, \tau^2)
\end{align*}
